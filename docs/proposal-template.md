# Introduction

Our project is a hardcore platformer with a theme of timeperiod advancement. The player begins the game as a Caveman/Neanderthal and is able to advance to more developed/modern castes by passing levels and achieving experience.
We plan to include various items such as weapons and powerups. We will also develop a number of enemies based on the timeperiod theme. One important distinction is that no progress carries over between runs. Every time you die, you lose all items and have to start again. 

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using Unity to create our game. Unity implements the C# programming language which we as a group will have to learn and use for our game.

# Method/Approach

We plan to split up the work amongst ourselves. This has yet to be decided, but the work includes: 

* Menu Design 
* Level Design 
* Item Design 
* NPC Development
* Character Design
* Overall control and actions of the character. 

This isn't everything that has to be done but it's a start of the work that has to be split amongst us evenly. The goal is to meet every Friday around 2pm to go over difficulties that may have arisen. As well as go over what has been completed and what still needs to be finished. As more challenges arise or as the due date approaches we may end up meeting 2 or 3 times per week to help keep ourselves on track.

# Estimated Timeline

* Controls completed(attacking, moving, etc.) - 2-3 weeks
* First level completed - 2 weeks
* First item completed - 1-2 weeks
* Shops/stores added - 3 weeks
* All levels completed - 9-10 weeks
* All items completed - 6-7 weeks

# Anticipated Problems

 - Getting associated with unity
 - Learning C#
 - Prioritization
