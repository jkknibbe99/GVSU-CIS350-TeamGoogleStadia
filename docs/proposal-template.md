# Introduction

Our project is a hardcore platformer with a theme of timeperiod advancement. The player begins the game as a Caveman/Neanderthal and is able to advance to more developed/modern castes by passing levels and achieving experience.
We plan to include various items such as weapons and powerups. We will also develop a number of enemies based on the timeperiod theme. 

# Anticipated Technologies

We will be using Unity to create our game. Unity implements the C# programming language which we as a group will have to learn and use for our game.
